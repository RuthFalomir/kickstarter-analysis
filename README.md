# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our project had the goal of analysing Louise's data set to understand what charcateristics help projects succeed and get the funding they need, and which ones don't. More specifically, our client wans to know how the different campaigns did in relation to two main factors: launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
Our purpose is to analyze the data and bring our insights to our client, in order for her to make better future decisions in regards to when to start funding and how much money to ask for future endeavours. 

## Analysis and Challenges
During the analysis, we used Excel to play with the data set. We first got familiar with the information it provided. One important challenge we found was that some columns didn't present the information in a way that was easy to use. Some adjustments had to be made in order to create a better division of the data. Once we had the columns we needed, we worked with filters, pivot tables and dynamic charts. All these tools gave us important insights. We will provide further information below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
During our analysis about theater outcomes based on the projects' launch dates, we found that the best period of the year to launch is during May-June with 111 and 100 successful outcomes respectively. May being the absolute best month of the year to start. On the other hand, we found that projects launched during November and December had the worst outcomes with only 54 and 37 successful plays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
During this analysis, we built a range of amounts in dollars set for goals of each project. We then found how many projects had been successful, how many failed, or got canceled out of the total amount. We found that the goal range less than $1,000 turned out to have the highest number of successful rates with a 76%. Whereas goals set on the $45,000 to $49,000 goal range had no success whatsoever. Goals set over the $14,999 limit had lower tending success rates from 50% to 20%, with the exception of the $35,000 to $44,999 range which yearned a 67% success rate. However, it is important to mention that only 9 projects were included in this last range, (where 6 were successful) compared to the 534 projects included in the $1,000 to $4,999 range category that had the second best success rate of 73%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We had a great dataset to analyze, however we did have to change some formats in order to make the information easier to work with. For example, launch and end dates were originally formatted as time stamps. To fix this, we had to convert them to a format that was easier to read.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The number one conclusion is to launch projects during May - June and avoid doing so during November - December. However, we have a wider range of possible dates where successful projects were launched all the way from April to August. 
The second insight is that February presents an interesting opportunity to launch projects because it reaches success levels comparable to those of the previously mentioned range.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In conclusion, lower goals tend to have both greater amount of projects and higher success rates than higher, more demanding goals. If Louise wants to successfully obtain funding, we recommend that she sets goals under $4,999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Even though the data set is very thorough, there are still missing pieces that can influence the insights we found, so caution is recommended always. One of the limitations is that categories included in this data set are extremely varied, so one must be careful when comparing goal amounts/outcomes because of the nature of the projects being compared.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
There are many analysis possibilities, including segmenting information by country, or even analyzing which topics make plays more attractive and more successful for fund raising.

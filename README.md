# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
This project was about performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends in order to give recommendations to our client Louise.
Among our findings, we analyzed outcomes based on the projects' launch dates. These findings are as follows:

Another interesting insight is the Parent Category Outcomes, which are:

For our final recommendations, we believe projects should be launched during the month of May, since data proves that they are usually more successful than the rest of the year. On the other hand, goals for projects are mostly set too high, which tend to make them less successful. Clear motives for this haven't been found yet. Further analysis will be conducted to get more indepth conclusions.
